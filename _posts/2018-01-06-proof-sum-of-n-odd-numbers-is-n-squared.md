title: Proof â€“ sum of first n odd numbers equals n squared
---

$$\forall n\in \mathbb{N}: \sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(2k+1)=n^2$$

Proof:

Sum of first $n$ numbers in a series is defined as

$$s_n=\frac{n}{2}(2a_1+(n-1)d)$$

where $a_1$ is the first element of a series.

To find out the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers, let $a_1=1$ and $d=2$.

$$s_n=\frac{n}{2}(2+(n-1)2)\\
s_n=\frac{n}{2}(2n)\\
s_n=n^2$$

$\square$
